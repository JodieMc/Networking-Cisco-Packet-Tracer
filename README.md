# Networking-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

An assignment to set up a small network using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
An addressing scheme was designed to divide the network space into subnets, allowing for up to 30 hosts per subnet. 
The network was built and configured based on the addressing scheme, with all devices on the network able to reach each other.
